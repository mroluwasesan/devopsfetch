## üõ† Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mroluwasesan/devopsfetch.git

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The devopsfetch tool is configured during installation. The systemd service is set to monitor activities from the current date. If you need to modify the date range or other settings, edit the systemd service file:

    
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/devopsfetch.service
   
After making changes, reload the systemd daemon and restart the service:

    
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart devopsfetch.service

## üñ• Usage

DevOpsFetch can be used with various command-line flags:

Usage: devopsfetch [-h] [-p [port_number]] [-d [container_name]] [-n [domain]] [-u [username]] [-t [date_range]]

Examples
1. Display help:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -h

2. List all active ports:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -p

3. Get information about a specific port:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -p 80

4. List all Docker containers:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -d


5. Get information about a specific Docker container:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -d mycontainer

6. List all Nginx domains:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -n

7. Get configuration for a specific Nginx domain:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -n example.com

8. List all users and their last login times:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -u

9. Get information about a specific user:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -u johndoe

10. Display activities within a date range:

    ```bash
    devopsfetch -t "2024-07-22 2024-07-23"

## üìä Logging
DevOpsFetch logs its activities to /var/log/devopsfetch.log. Log rotation is configured to manage the log file size and retention.
To view the logs:

    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/devopsfetch.log

Log rotation settings can be modified in /etc/logrotate.d/devopsfetch.
